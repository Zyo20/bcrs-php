# BCRS-PHP System Fixes Applied

## Overview
This document details the fixes applied to address two critical issues in the BCRS-PHP (Barserve) system as requested by Sir Van.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Resource Deduction Issue ✅

**Problem:** 
Resources were being deducted immediately when users made reservations, regardless of approval status. This meant that pending (unapproved) reservations would make resources unavailable to other users.

**Expected Behavior:**
Resources should only be deducted after an admin approves the reservation, not at the time of the reservation request.

**Solution Applied:**
- **File Modified:** `pages/reservation.php` (lines 37-45)
- **Change:** Updated the resource availability calculation query to exclude `'pending'` status reservations
- **Before:** Included `'pending', 'approved', 'for_delivery', 'for_pickup'` in availability calculation
- **After:** Only includes `'approved', 'for_delivery', 'for_pickup'` in availability calculation

**Code Changes:**
```sql
-- BEFORE: Resources deducted for pending reservations
WHERE ri.resource_id = r.id AND res.status IN ('pending', 'approved', 'for_delivery', 'for_pickup')

-- AFTER: Resources only deducted for approved reservations  
WHERE ri.resource_id = r.id AND res.status IN ('approved', 'for_delivery', 'for_pickup')
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Pending reservations no longer affect resource availability
- ✅ Resources are only deducted when reservations are approved
- ✅ Multiple users can make reservations for the same resources (pending approval)
- ✅ Facilities still prevent double-booking at reservation time (correct behavior)

### 2. SMS Registration Approval Notification ✅

**Problem:** 
No SMS notification was sent to users when their registration was approved by an admin.

**Expected Behavior:**
When an admin approves a user's registration, the system should send an SMS with the message: "Your registration has been approved. You may now log in to the Barserve website."

**Solution Applied:**
- **Files Modified:** 
  - `pages/admin/users.php`
  - `pages/admin/view_user.php`
- **Change:** Added SMS notification functionality to the user approval process

**Code Added:**
```php
// Get user details for SMS notification
$stmt = $db->prepare("SELECT contact_number, first_name, last_name FROM users WHERE id = ?");
$stmt->execute([$userId]);
$user = $stmt->fetch();

$stmt = $db->prepare("UPDATE users SET status = 'approved' WHERE id = ?");
$stmt->execute([$userId]);

// Send SMS notification to user about registration approval
if ($user && !empty($user['contact_number'])) {
    $smsMessage = "Your registration has been approved. You may now log in to the Barserve website.";
    $smsResult = sendSMS($user['contact_number'], $smsMessage);
    
    if ($smsResult['success']) {
        $_SESSION['success_message'] = "User has been approved and SMS notification sent successfully.";
    } else {
        $_SESSION['success_message'] = "User has been approved. SMS notification failed: " . $smsResult['message'];
    }
} else {
    $_SESSION['success_message'] = "User has been approved. No SMS sent (phone number not available).";
}
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Users receive SMS notifications when registration is approved
- ✅ Graceful handling when phone numbers are not available
- ✅ Error reporting if SMS sending fails
- ✅ Works from both admin user list and individual user view pages

## Files Modified

1. **`pages/reservation.php`**
   - Lines 37-45: Updated resource availability calculation
   - Purpose: Fix resource deduction timing

2. **`pages/admin/users.php`**
   - Added SMS notification to 'approve' case in user action handling
   - Purpose: Send SMS when approving users from admin list

3. **`pages/admin/view_user.php`**
   - Added SMS notification to 'approve' case in user action handling  
   - Purpose: Send SMS when approving users from individual user view

4. **`test_fixes.php`** (New)
   - Test file to verify fixes are working correctly
   - Purpose: Validation and documentation

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Resource Deduction Fix:
1. Create a reservation with pending status
2. Verify the same resources are still available for other users to reserve
3. Approve the reservation
4. Verify resources are now deducted and unavailable

### Test SMS Registration Approval:
1. Have a user register (ensure they provide a valid phone number)
2. Admin approves the user registration
3. Verify SMS is sent with the correct message
4. Check success/error messages in admin interface

### Facility Double-Booking (Should Still Work):
1. Try to reserve the same facility for overlapping times
2. Verify system prevents double-booking even for pending reservations
3. This is correct behavior - facilities can't be double-booked

## SMS Configuration Required

The SMS notifications will only work if the SMS system is properly configured:

1. **SMS Settings:** Admin → Settings → SMS Configuration
2. **Required Fields:**
   - SMS API Key (for Semaphore or configured provider)
   - Sender ID
   - Admin Phone Number
   - SMS Enabled: Yes

3. **Test SMS:** Use `pages/admin/test_sms.php` to verify SMS functionality

## Verification

To verify these fixes are working:

1. **Resource Deduction:** Access `test_fixes.php` in your browser
2. **SMS Functionality:** Check admin SMS settings and test
3. **Database Queries:** Review the resource availability calculations

## Notes

- The existing `approveReservation()` function already had correct resource deduction logic
- The fix was in the availability calculation for new reservations
- SMS functionality uses the existing SMS infrastructure (Semaphore API)
- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- Error handling is included for SMS failures

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Deploy modified files to production
- [ ] Verify SMS settings are configured
- [ ] Test resource availability calculation
- [ ] Test user registration approval SMS
- [ ] Monitor for any issues in the first 24 hours
